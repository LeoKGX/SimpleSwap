# SimpleSwap
SimpleSwap is a minimal Automated Market Maker (AMM) smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to add liquidity, remove liquidity, and swap between two ERC-20 tokens while issuing ERC-20 liquidity tokens as proof of pool share. Inspired by Uniswap V2 for educational purposes for the third module of ETHKipu Course.
